    <h1>Advanced Infiltrating Malware</h1>
  </header>
  <p>This page covers advanced infiltration techniques (fileless attacks, rootkits, lateral movement) and the detection and response strategies used to find and contain them. Click each box title to learn about specific techniques and protections.</p>

      <h2>Fileless Malware</h2>
      <p>Fileless malware operates in memory and leverages legitimate tools (like PowerShell) to avoid leaving traditional file traces. Defenses include application whitelisting, endpoint monitoring, and strict execution policies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>Rootkits & Persistence</h2>
      <p>Rootkits alter low-level system behavior to hide malicious processes and maintain persistence. Detecting them usually requires specialized scanning and integrity checks; prevention focuses on limiting privileged access and keeping firmware/OS patched.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h2>Lateral Movement</h2>
      <p>Once inside, sophisticated malware moves laterally across networks to escalate impact. Network segmentation, strong authentication, and monitoring for unusual account behavior reduce the chances of wide compromise.</p>
