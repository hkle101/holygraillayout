        <h2><a href="commonattacks.html">Common Attacks</a></h2>
    <p>Common cyber attacks include phishing, social engineering, man-in-the-middle, denial-of-service, and injection attacks. Phishing tricks users into revealing credentials or installing malicious software, while injection attacks exploit unvalidated inputs. Defenses include user training, multi-factor authentication, regular patching, and input validation to reduce exposure.</p>

        <h2><a href="harmfulsoftware.html">Harmful Software</a></h2>
    <p>Harmful software (malware) covers viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, adware, and ransomware — each with different goals such as stealing data, disrupting services, or extorting users. Identifying malware often requires scanning, behavioral monitoring, and keeping systems up to date. Practical mitigation includes reputable antivirus tools, principle of least privilege, strong backups, and cautious handling of downloads and attachments.</p>

        <h2><a href="malware.html">Malware That Infiltrates</a></h2>
    <p>Some malware infiltrates systems stealthily using fileless techniques, rootkits, or polymorphic code that changes to evade detection. These threats can persist and move laterally through networks if not detected early. Detecting and responding to advanced infiltration requires endpoint detection and response (EDR), network monitoring, strict access controls, and a practiced incident response plan to contain and remediate compromises quickly.</p>
