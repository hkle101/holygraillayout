			<h2>Phishing & Social Engineering</h2>
			<p>Phishing relies on deceptive messages that trick people into revealing credentials or installing malware. Social engineering extends this to phone calls or other manipulations. Look for suspicious senders, verify requests out-of-band, and never share passwords over email.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h2>Injection Attacks</h2>
			<p>Injection (for example SQL or command injection) exploits unvalidated inputs to run unintended commands on a server. Prevent these with input validation, prepared statements/parameterized queries, and strict escaping.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h2>Denial of Service (DoS)</h2>
			<p>DoS and DDoS attacks flood services with traffic to make them unavailable. Mitigations include rate limiting, CDN/waf protection, and scalable infrastructure to absorb spikes.</p>
